* My ergodox layout for easy sharing between work and home
The aim is to get a decent layout for typing [[http://aoeu.info/][svorak]] on. Which happens to be
the swedish dvorak of my choice.

** How to flash
You can download the firmware from here:
[[https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/5B5vE/latest/0]]

Or use the file named =ergodox_ez_elis-s-svorak-layout_ABw90_o9zDe.hex= which
is provided in this repository.

I also include the source file downloaded from the configurator, these lives
in the =src/= directory but aren't actually used at this moment.

To flash you should run the following command:
: sudo teensy-loader-cli -mmcu=atmega32u4 -w ergodox_ez....hex -v

Then press the flash button on the Teensy on the board, or one of the Flash
buttons on the keyboard. But this depends on the layout applied on the board
if they exist or not.
