* My ergodox keyboard layouts
I've have used ErgoDox Infinity for many years and have used this repository
to transfer the keyboard layout configuration between my home keyboard and
work keyboard.

But now I have got myself an ErgoDox EZ-compatible device from falba.tech.

So now the repository have been repurposed to contain both of these layouts.
